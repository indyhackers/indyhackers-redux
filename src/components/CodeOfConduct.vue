          <h2>The Quick Version</h2>
          <p>
            Our events/community/slack organizations are dedicated to providing a harassment-free
            experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age,
            sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity,
            religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of
            event participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at the
            event. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the
            event without a refund at the discretion of the event organisers.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>
          <p>
            Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and
            expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
            ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate
            intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained
            disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome
            sexual attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the board members may take any action
            they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event/slack
            org.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
            concerns, please contact a member of board immediately. Board members can be identified
            above.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, or
            otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the
            event/life of the slack organization. We value your participation!
          </p>

          <h2>Posting Jobs</h2>
          <p>
            We encourage members of this community to post jobs that include salary ranges. We
            understand that it is not always possible, but it helps job seekers by

              Saving research time looking at similar compensation packages on Glassdoor or
              LinkedIn, which may not always be accurate

            <li>Providing clear insight to fair and equitable pay across your organization</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While we prefer postings with salary ranges, our role is to be inclusive and welcoming.
            To that effort, we also encourage job posters who may not have the power to post salary
            ranges to reach out to the community for tools and insights on how to advocate for
            public salary ranges in your organization.

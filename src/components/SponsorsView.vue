      Indy Hackers is built on the incredible spirit and generosity of our community. Whether you're
      helping a fellow hacker, sharing industry insights, or making that key introduction, your
      contributions have made a real impact. To keep building on this momentum, we're excited to
      partner with sponsors who share our vision of growing the tech scene in Indiana. Every
      sponsorship directly fuels better events, new opportunities, and more resources for our
      members.
